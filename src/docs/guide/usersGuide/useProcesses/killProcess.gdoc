The process can be killed, it means that all process activities should be stopped, all active nodes and process should
be set to status 'KILLED'.

When the process starting killing procedure from UI, first of all we interrupt process invocation thread, then update
process status (and all active nodes) to 'KILLING'. The next step - we check _actions_ thread - the thread
where we execute actions code. If there is no alive _actions_ thread, then we update process status (and its active
nodes) to "KILLED". If we have _actions_ thread then try to interrupt it. This thread will check the interrupted flag
for process, in case of interrupted flag we set process status (and its active nodes) to "KILLED".

During process execution we can have exceptions in node execution. In case of exceptions, the process can be killed too.
