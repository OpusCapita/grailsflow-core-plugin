The functionality of the *Show Embedded Worklist* is the same as Show Worklist with the only difference being that the
Worklist displays in a pop-up window, without any headers.

The Embedded worklist helps you to view the nodes simultaneously, while working on other screen

Refer Show Worklist section for more details.
