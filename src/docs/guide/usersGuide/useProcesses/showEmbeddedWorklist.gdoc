The functionality of *Show Embedded Worklist* is same as *Show Worklist*. The only difference is that the *Worklist*
displays in a pop-up window, without any headers. Refer *Show Worklist* section for more details. The *Embedded worklist*
helps you to view the nodes simultaneously, while working on other screen.
