The Show Documents menu displays directories which contain files (which has Document type variable) uploaded for the
process.

Documents are a special type of process variables that allows storing arbitrary files in a process. You declare a
process variable in your process class through the process designer with the type Documents. When you enter variables,
GrailsFlow presents a â€œBrowserâ€ button to upload documents. The file is uploaded and stored in a directory.

A directory is created for each day. The file name is cleaned up and extended by the process id and a counter. The link
to the file is stored in the DB.

If the variable can be changed in a later step, the file can be downloaded and a new version can be uploaded. The new
version is stored the same way, so GrailsFlow provides a full version history for documents.

*'Show Documents'* lists the documents that are attached to processes. Documents are stored as simple files in the file
system.
