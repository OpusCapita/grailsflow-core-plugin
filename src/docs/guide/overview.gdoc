h4. GrailsFlow is an open source Workflow and Process Engine.
It is written using Groovy and Grails (Grails Plugin) and can easily integrate with other Java, Groovy or Grails
applications. GrailsFlow provides:

* a complete out of the box workflow and process management system
* a very simple structure and is easy to understand
* a Groovy based DSL to define the process, not XML
* complete user interface for process definition, worklist management and process monitoring

Target usage of the system is for midsize applications with 10.000Â´s of processes in the application and hundreds of new
processes per day.

h4. Architecture

The application is written in Groovy and Grails. Process Definition are stored as plain Groovy classes, that fulfill
certain coding conventions. The integration of GrailsFlow into Grails is in some respect similiar to the integration of
Spring Webflow.

The target usage of the system is for midsize applications with 10.000's of processes in the application and hundreds of
new processes per day. Currently it does not aim to be a solution to manage millions of processes per year, however the
design would allow that.
